# Multiface_Detection
This project focuses on enhancing face detection in crowded urban environments using an improved MTCNN algorithm. By employing data augmentation, redesigning the detection network with deep separable convolution, and optimizing the Non-Maximum Suppression (NMS) algorithm, the improved method offers faster processing and higher accuracy.
